JSnowball is a program for performing systematic literature studies through snowballing and for visualization of citation relations between academic papers.

## Dependencies

* [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
* Java 17
* [JPackage Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/petr-panteleyev/jpackage-gradle-plugin)
* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

All dependencies, except for the JDK and JRE are automatically installed by the Gradle wrapper build script.

## Build

```
./gradlew build
```

### Building Windows executable

Run the following commands in Powershell.
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
.\WindowsBuild.ps1

The script automatically downloads a JDK and the WiX installer and then runs the Gradle wrapper build script. An installer bundle will appear in app\build\dist.
